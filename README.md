## Project Overview

For this project, I was given starter files like `TreasureMaze.py`, `GameExperience.py`, and a partially finished notebook. I had to fill in the missing code for the `qtrain()` function and build a deep Q-learning algorithm that trains a pirate agent to find the treasure. It was my job to make sure the pirate could learn to find the treasure without errors.

## Connection to Computer Science

Computer scientists build programs, solve problems, and try to make life easier or more interesting through technology. It matters because everything we do today depends on people who can design smart, reliable systems.

When I run into a problem, I usually try to break it down into small parts first instead of thinking about everything at once. Then I work step by step, test my ideas, and fix stuff as I go.

I think itâ€™s important to always remember my work affects real people. I need to make sure I protect user data, be fair with how my programs work, and be honest about what my code can and can't do.
